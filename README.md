# Welcome,

Here you'll find traces of my journey to learning more about data analytics and programming. Tired of Excel's shortcomings for large datasets, I decided to turn my attention towards programming languages, specifically Python and SQL, and how to use them for more advanced data analysis.

The files you see above are the projects I worked on to obtain certifications in Python programming, data analysis with Python & Pandas, data manipulation & visualization and data mining & cleaning (ongoing). Next on the list will be learning how to work with SQL and APIs, using Python for statistical analysis and a quick introduction to R. Some projects are a bit shorter than others, but I will go back to them as I learn more so I may apply any new learnings.

If you have any advice, feel free to connect with me on https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexjsing/ where you'll also be able to see the certifications I've gained.
