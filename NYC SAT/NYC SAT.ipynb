    "# I. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most controversial issues in the U.S. educational system is the efficacy of standardized tests, and whether they're unfair to certain groups. Given our prior knowledge of this topic, investigating the correlations between SAT scores and demographics might be an interesting angle to take. We could correlate SAT scores with factors like race, gender, income, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SAT, or Scholastic Aptitude Test, is an exam that U.S. high school students take before applying to college. Colleges take the test scores into account when deciding who to admit, so it's fairly important to perform well on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test consists of three sections, each of which has 800 possible points. The combined score is out of 2,400 possible points (while this number has changed a few times, the data set for our project is based on 2,400 total points). Organizations often rank high schools by their average SAT scores. The scores are also considered a measure of overall school district quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "New York City makes its data on high school SAT scores available online, as well as the demographics for each high school. We'll need to combine several interrelated datasets into one before we can find correlations. Below are the datasets we'll be using.\n",
    " - SAT scores by school - SAT scores for each high school in New York City\n",
    " - School attendance - Attendance information for each school in New York City\n",
    " - Class size - Information on class size for each school\n",
    " - AP test results - Advanced Placement (AP) exam results for each high school\n",
    " - Graduation outcomes - The percentage of students who graduated, and other outcome information\n",
    " - Demographics - Demographic information for each school\n",
    " - School survey - Surveys of parents, teachers, and students at each school"

    "# III. Combining the Data Sets\n",
    "### Condensing Class Size Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The main data set we want to analyze, *Sat_Results*, has unique DBN values for every high school in New York City while other data sets have duplicate DBN values. A single row in the *Sat_Results* data set may match multiple rows in the *Class_Size* data set, for example. This situation will create problems, because we don't know which of the multiple entries in the *Class_Size* data set we should combine with the single matching entry in sat_results. Before merging the data sets, we'll condense the class size, graduation, and demographics data sets so that each DBN is unique."
